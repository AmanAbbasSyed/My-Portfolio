<h1> The Best Movies according to Aman SA </h1>
<h2> My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Jersy</h3>
<p>One movie that I would watch again and again for millions of times.<br/> Its mainly because it incorporates a great bounceback story in a cricketing back drop.</p>
<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>A masterpiece that shouwed me peaks of euphoria in a cinema theater.<br/> I doubt if I could ever get any other movie experience even close to this.</p>
<h3>Swayamkrushi</h3>
<p>A movie that gives a great soft hearted feel while watching and eventually inspires you in life.<br/> And special mention to the greaat actor in Chiranjeevi</p>
